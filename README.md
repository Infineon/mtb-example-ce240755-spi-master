## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

To verify the output, you will need two devices: one acting as the master and the other as the slave.

1. Use the [mtb-example-CE240756-spi-slave](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-CE240756-spi-slave) example to run as the SPI slave on the second kit.

2. Connect the following pins of the master to the corresponding pins of the slave using jumper wires: CYBSP_SPI_SCLK, CYBSP_SPI_MOSI, CYBSP_SPI_MISO, and CYBSP_SPI_CS.

> **Note:** This code example provides the custom *design.modus* files under the template directory for certain BSPs that do not have aliases for the SPI pins by default (for example, CYBSP_SPI_MOSI, CYBSP_SPI_MISO, CYBSP_SPI_SCLK, CYBSP_SPI_CS). Other BSPs already have these aliases defined in the default *design.modus* file and, therefore, do not need any customization.


## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.



Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).

This example requires no additional software or tools.



## Using the code example

### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool.

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*).

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target).

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**.

   > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you.

   b.	Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box.

   > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box.

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**.

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.



The following example clones the "[mtb-example-CE240755-spi-master](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-CE240755-spi-master)" application with the desired name "SpiMaster" configured for the *KIT_T2G_C-2D-6M_LITE* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_T2G_C-2D-6M_LITE --app-id mtb-example-CE240755-spi-master --user-app-name SpiMaster --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```



The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

</details>



### Open the project

After the project has been created, you can open it in your preferred development environment.


<details><summary><b>Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

## Operation



1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to '8N1' and '115200' baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```

    </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "PDL: SPI master" is displayed on the UART terminal.

## Design and implementation

### Resources and settings

The Arm&reg; Cortex&reg; CPU controls the master SPI resource. The master sends packets to the slave with the commands to turn the user LED ON or OFF. These packets are sent at one-second intervals. The slave receives the packets and controls the LED based on the received command.

### Resources and settings

**Table 4. Application resources**

 Resource  |  Alias/object     |    Purpose
 :-------  | :------------     | :------------
 SPI       |      SPI_M        | Master SPI
 UART      |      UART         | UART object used by `retarget-io` for debug UART port
